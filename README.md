# password_generator

## In this application, I created a random password generator. The class we had before this assignment was due helped a lot in explaining different steps that needed to be laid out in order to accomplish this. After the class, I had a tutoring session. Jose helped me understand why my code would continue to run after a certain amount of times when the user put in wrong information. I ChatGPT helped as well. My biggest challenge with this application was including the generatePassword function. I was able to get the code to run properly with out it. Because it was given to us in the original code, I was under the impression that it was to be included in the final application code. I was finally able to figure out that the generatePassword function needed to be defined within the writePassword function.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This password generator prompts the user to enter how many characters they'd like in their password, and which kinds of characters they'd like to include. The  it generates a random password based on the users specifications.

## Credits

I receieved guidance on this application from my instructor, JD Tadlock in class. I also received further explanation of those concepts from Jose Lopez during a subsequent tutoring session. Lastly, I referred to ChatGPT to help me figure out where my syntax was incorrect.
